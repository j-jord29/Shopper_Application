# Shopper_Application

### Why are we doing this?

The aim of the porject is to create a shopping application where users can find recipes and compare it to the items in their home

### How I expected the challenge to go.

The challenge had some difficult moments, such as trying to implement test files and exceptions. Another problem I had was trying to update the elements in some of the classes.

### What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

Implementing the controllers, repository and other elements went well, testing, exception handling and some of the update functions did not work. I had a lot of errors inwhich I didn't have the knowledge to resolve

### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

I'm want to spend more time adding features, create a front end and change around some of the code to better implement it
